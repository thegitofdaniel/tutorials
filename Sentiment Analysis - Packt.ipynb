    "- https://hub.packtpub.com/how-to-perform-sentiment-analysis-using-python-tutorial/\n",
    "- The idea of conducting a sentiment analysis sounds very sophisticated, but this tutorial is fairly simple. 'Sentiments' are defined a-priori: you are given a dataset with reviews and their sentiment (positive or negative). Your only task is to create a classifier calibrated, i.e. a function that reads reviews and attributes one of the possible sentiments. The classifier should be calibrated on training data, validated on test data, and used to classify new data. "

      "will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \n",
      "for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence . \n",
      "it's a trait associated with what my brother calls \" too good for this world \" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \n",
      "forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die . \n",
      "this is no formula movie . \n",
      "in fact , it's quite fresh and original . \n",
      "it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \n",
      "will works whatever kind of job he can get . \n",
      "first he's a janitor , then he works construction . \n",
      "off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \n",
      "on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \n",
      "lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \n",
      "having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \n",
      "he is firmly rejected . \n",
      "finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \n",
      "lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \n",
      "will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \n",
      "lambeau treats will like a son . \n",
      "he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics . \n",
      "he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \n",
      "will isn't really interested in academia . \n",
      "he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \n",
      "he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart . \n",
      "meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \n",
      "it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's \" a \" list . \n",
      "will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \n",
      "shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . \n",
      "lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \n",
      "knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \n",
      "true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . \n",
      "but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \n",
      "like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \n",
      "like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \n",
      "robin williams is excellent in this role . \n",
      "he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \n",
      "in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \n",
      "williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \n",
      "i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . \n",
      "emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \n",
      "he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \n",
      "sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \n",
      "his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \n",
      "if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \n",
      "it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \n",
      "it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . \n",
      "this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . \n",
      "but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \n",
      "a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \n",
      "it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \n",
      "good will hunting has all three . \n",
